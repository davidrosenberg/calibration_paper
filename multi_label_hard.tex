\section{Multi-label calibration}

We conclude by explaining some big challenges that remain with calibration. In this work, we primarily focus on single label calibration. We also include an experiment on \emph{marginal calibration}, where the goal is to ensure that the probability estimate for each label, taken in isolation, is calibrated. However, true multi-label calibration is a significant challenge. The most popular approach proposed is temperature scaling. But only tested on top prediction calibration, our experiments show it does worse on both top label calibration and marginal calibration. Define true multi-label calibration.
